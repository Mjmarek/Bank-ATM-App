## Bank ATM Console App

**Description:** Using this console application, bank customers can enter their PIN to access their bank account.  Once their PIN has been validated, they can check the balance of their savings account or checking account.  They can also deposit funds and make withdrawals.

**Extension:** In the future, I would like to add additional functionality so that customers can transfer money from one account to another.  In addition, one PIN should give a customer access to all their accounts; a different PIN should not be assigned to each individual account.  To replicate a more realistic banking model, multiple customers should be able to share the same bank account but have their own unique PIN to access the account.  Finally, customers should be able to transfer money to each other.
